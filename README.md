# Memoris

![Image 1](github/readme.png)

Memoris is a video game developed in C++ using the SFML library. During the game, the player moves a pin on a 2D map. The map contains floors. Each floor contains cells. The player can move the pin from one cell to another. The goal is to move the pin from the departure to the arrival, find all the stars on the map, take the bonus ( life, time... etc... ), avoid the malus ( life minus one, less time... etc... )... etc... The map contains different kind of events that change the cells dispositions ( horizontal/vertical symmetry, rotation, translation, move from one floor to another... etc... ).

Before each level, the player can see all the cells of the level during a limited time ( a few seconds... ). After this period, all the cells of the level are hidden and the pin can move.

The game is divided into series, each series contain different level. Levels are integrated into the game. The player can also create his own series and levels.

**NOTE: this work is in progress. Some features are not implemented yet, some of them are partially implemented.**

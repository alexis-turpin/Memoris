# Memoris
Memoris is a 2D graphical video game developped in C++ using the SFML media library. 
The objective is to move a pin from one departure to a destination on an invisible map. 
This map is only visualized by the player a few instant before the game start. 
The gameplay has to be rich in action, bonus, malus, time constraint... etc...

The game must contains music, be original, the actions and events must be complex and funny enough to make the game a little bit crazy. :)

```
```
make
```

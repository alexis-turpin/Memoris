# Memoris
Memoris is a 2D graphical video game developped in C++ using the SFML media library. 
The objective is to move a pin from one departure to a destination on an invisible map. The player can only see the map a few seconds before the game starts. 
The gameplay has to be rich in actions, bonus, malus, time constraint... etc...
